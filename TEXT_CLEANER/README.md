# üßπ Text Cleaner Script ‚Äì Python Project

This is a beginner-friendly, real-world Python script that takes user input and returns a cleaned version of the text. It was built as part of my foundational Python training.

---

## üìå Features

- Removes unnecessary spaces (leading, trailing, and multiple internal spaces)
- Removes punctuation (like `.,!?;:-`)
- Removes digits (optional line)
- Does  `Title Case` versions
- Written using functions for reusability
- Includes a loop to clean multiple texts without restarting

## üß† Skills Practiced

| Skill | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Input handling** | Using `input()` safely for real-world text |
| **String processing** | Using `.strip()`, `.split()`, `.join()` |
| **Text cleaning** | `str.translate()`, `string.punctuation`, `.isdigit()` |
| **List comprehensions** | Filtering digits cleanly |
| **Modular thinking** | Wrapping logic inside a function |
| **README writing** | Documenting code clearly for others to understand |

## üöÄ Future Improvements (Planned)

- Let user choose whether to:
  - Remove digits? (y/n)
  - Remove punctuation? (y/n)
  - Use lowercase or Title Case?
- Accept input from a `.txt` file
- Write cleaned output to a new file
- Build a simple web app version using Streamlit

## Note:

This small project shows:
- Clean code structure using functions
- Logical problem-solving mindset
- Willingness to write documentation (README)
- Ability to break down problems and implement solutions from scratch
- A clear learning path and ambition to improve each day
